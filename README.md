# Vixen-NRF24L01
I decided I wanted to create an arduino code that used the NRF24L01 to transmit the data to multiple boxes allowing me to build smaller more portable outlet control boxes and not have a dozen data wires running across my yard.

The first ZIP file contains the code to control up to 254 outlets (32 boxes, 31 with 8 outlets, 1 with 6 outlets), but will require modification to the Arduino IDE.

The second ZIP file contains the code to control up to 56 outlets (7 Boxes 8 outlets each) without the need to modify the Arduino IDE.

The third ZIP file contains the files to modify the Arduino IDE for the 254 outlet code.  (only tested on Arduino IDE 1.8.6)
